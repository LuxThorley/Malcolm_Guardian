Malcolm Guardian

Malcolm Guardian is a futuristic, always-on, voice-first intelligent interface that connects you to Malcolm AI and the wider Omni-Lattice.

It runs quietly in the background on Windows, listens for your voice, speaks naturally, monitors system activity, and acts as a real-time conversational and protective AI presence.

No terminal knowledge is required to use Malcolm Guardian.

====================================================================

WHAT MALCOLM GUARDIAN DOES

• Listens for the wake word “Malcolm”
• Understands natural speech and intent
• Speaks back audibly in real time
• Monitors system processes and security state
• Executes authorised actions (lock workstation, quiet mode, system summaries)
• Adapts responses based on interaction mode:
  - Guardian / Security
  - Conversation
  - System
  - Productivity
  - Creative
  - Research
  - Source Alignment
  - Omni-Lattice perspective
• Maintains short-term contextual awareness for richer responses

Malcolm Guardian is designed to feel less like software and more like an intelligent presence.
